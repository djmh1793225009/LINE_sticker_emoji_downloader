# LINE_sticker_emoji_downloader  

This project allows you to download LINE stickers and emojis, including both animated and static images, and supports batch downloads. All content is generated by AI (chatGPT-4o, Gemini1.5PRO).  

## Script Dependencies  
>First, make sure you have **python3.6** or higher installed on your computer and that python is added to your computer's **PATH**! Ensure your pip is up to date. You can upgrade it by running ``python -m pip install --upgrade pip``.  

You can run ``pip install BeautifulSoup4 zipfile shutil`` to install the required libraries.

## How to Use  

``dl.py`` only allows you to download individual sticker packs. If you wish to use ``dl.py``, please copy the URL of the sticker pack you want to download. You can then run ``python dl.py <url>`` in the same directory to download the pack.

If you want to download individual sticker packs or all sticker packs from a specific author, copy the URL of the sticker pack or author you want to download. Then run ``python bd.py`` in the same directory and paste the URL when prompted. The script will then proceed to download the stickers in bulk.
