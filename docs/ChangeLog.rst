v0.1.2(2024-05-16)
-------------------

This version adds a feature to delete key thumbnails from zip files, saving me the trouble of repeatedly deleting key files and greatly improving my work efficiency!
In addition, since the script written by ChatGPT-4o still has bugs, I have manually modified some of the code, so the current code is no longer completely AI-generated, but is now **partially AI-generated!**
However, this version refers to `shutil` `zipfile` `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` dependencies, and you can install the dependencies by the following command.
```sh
python -m pip install requests beautifulsoup4 zipfile shutil
```

v0.1.1(2024-05-16)
-------------------

This version adds the function of crawling the name of the expression pack from the web page and renaming it, so now you won't encounter the problem of batch downloading because the names are all the same!
However, this version refers to `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` dependencies, and you can install the dependencies by the following command.
```sh
python -m pip install BeautifulSoup requests
```

v0.1.0(2024-05-16)
-------------------

This version distinguishes emoji from sticker, and then uses regular expressions to match the ID in the url and download it. The script is very elementary, but I hope you can enjoy it.
