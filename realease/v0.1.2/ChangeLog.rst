ChangeLog
==========

v0.1.2(2024-05-16)
-------------------

This version adds a feature to delete key thumbnails from zip files, saving me the trouble of repeatedly deleting key files and greatly improving my work efficiency!
In addition, since the script written by ChatGPT-4o still has bugs, I have manually modified some of the code, so the current code is no longer completely AI-generated, but is now **partially AI-generated!**
However, this version refers to `shutil` `zipfile` `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` dependencies, and you can install the dependencies by the following command.
```sh
python -m pip install requests beautifulsoup4 zipfile shutil
```
